            <p>Hi! I'm Hadi Hefzy (Behnam), and I'm running for GSA Vice-President External because I'm passionate about building strong connections, both within and beyond Carleton University. As an international student from Iran (and yes, like any true Iranian, I love engaging with people, whether it's on campus or in the city, I'm always ready to listen and help), I truly understand the challenges international students face and I'm eager to represent and support them.</p>
            <p>I'm an active, outgoing, and communication-driven person who believes that real change comes through meaningful dialogue. If elected, I will work to strengthen GSA's relationships with external organizations, improve outreach, and ensure every student, especially international graduate students - feels seen, heard, and included.</p>

        <h2>Temuulen Turbat (Elen) - GSA VP Academics</h2>
        <img src="Temuulen.jpg" alt="Temuulen Turbat">
        <div class="candidate-bio">
            <p>Hi, I'm Temuulen Turbat (Elen), and I'm excited to run for GSA VP Academics to advocate for graduate students. Originally from the steppes of Mongolia, I believe every graduate student deserves strong support, accessible resources, and real opportunities to succeed. The GSA should be a safe, inclusive, and empowering space, regardless of background, gender, or identity.</p>
            <p>As a core member of the Mongolia Inclusion & Diversity group, I've led initiatives to promote fair workplaces, secure funding for social causes, and advocate for equity. Now, I want to bring that same dedication to the GSA, ensuring every graduate student feels heard, valued, and supported.</p>
            <p>In academia, thriving goes beyond just meeting deadlines. We need a balance that supports our mental health and well-being, along with resources for career development, networking, professional skill-building, and clear, accessible GSA services. As a dog mom, I understand how essential it is to find this balance and to have a supportive, inclusive community to help us succeed.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Key Platform Points:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Expand career development programs</li>
            <li>Ensure graduate students' academic concerns are heard and effectively addressed</li>
            <li>Advocate for stronger mental health and wellness resources</li>
            <li>Foster an inclusive academic environment where every student feels represented and valued</li>

        <h2>Pasca Sugijarto - Graduate Faculty Board</h2>
        <img src="Pasca.jpg" alt="Pasca Sugijarto">
        <div class="candidate-bio">
            <p>I'm Pasca Sugijarto, I'm running for Graduate Faculty Board and I am happy to work together with Graduate Faculty members to bring forward issues that are close to Carleton Graduate Students.</p>
            <p>I come from a small family, from a small city in Indonesia. As a true Indonesian, I love "sambal" and "Indomie". I came to Canada with a small white dog named Bamse. He has been my champion through our first winter and helped me cope with every challenge I met as an international student.</p>
            <p>I believe in creating a family wherever I go - celebrate happy milestones, support positive actions, be there for sad moments and share good food. Therefore, I try to hold dear what is good and true because life comes with ups and downs. Friends - who are honest & sincere, who are good & true to others - are the family that will carry each other through those waves of life.</p>
            <p>I want to create a supportive and inclusive graduate community where students feel valued, empowered, and connected, like a family. I will advocate for initiatives that foster mentorship, peer support networks, and emotional well-being, ensuring that students have a support system throughout their academic journey.</p>
